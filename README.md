# DDPM SDE

A minimal PyTorch implementation of [Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456).

Here are some images generated by the model (Sub-VP SDE) trained on CIFAR-10 for about 310K steps, using the Euler–Maruyama predictor:

This implementation is heavily based on the [official implementation](https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch). Currently, it features only the Sub-VP SDE with the [Euler–Maruyama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Maruyama_method) predictor and no corrector. As for the architectural changes to the U-Net, I've implemented only the scaling of skip connections.
